# Profile Picture Upload Fix - Complete Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive fix implemented for the profile picture upload functionality in the Caj-pro application. The issue was that users could edit and save profile settings, but could not upload or change their profile picture.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Authentication Mismatch
**Problem**: Profile actions were using `cajpro_auth_token` cookie while the rest of the application uses `auth-token` cookie.

**Solution**: Updated all profile actions in `actions/profile-actions.ts` to use the correct authentication method with `auth-token` cookie and production auth service.

### 2. Database Schema Mismatch  
**Problem**: Profile actions were querying the `profiles` table using `id` as primary key instead of `user_id` as foreign key.

**Solution**: Updated all database queries in profile actions to use `user_id` as the foreign key column, matching the current database schema.

### 3. Missing API Endpoint
**Problem**: The AvatarUpload component was calling a server action, but we needed a proper API endpoint for file uploads.

**Solution**: Created a new API endpoint at `/api/uploads/avatars/route.ts` that handles:
- File upload validation (type, size limits)
- Secure file storage in the server filesystem
- Database updates with avatar URLs
- Avatar removal functionality

### 4. UI Not Connected
**Problem**: The profile page had the upload button disabled with "Avatar upload coming soon" message instead of using the existing AvatarUpload component.

**Solution**: Updated the profile page to use the existing `AvatarUpload` component, which provides full upload functionality with file validation, preview, and error handling.

### 5. Storage Configuration
**Problem**: Storage was configured for Linux development environment and Supabase storage instead of local file system.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `.env.local` with Windows-compatible storage path
- Set `USE_SERVER_STORAGE=true` to enable file system storage
- Created storage directory structure at `C:\Users\honer\Documents\src\car-project-manager\storage\avatars`

**Error Response**:
```json
{
  "error": "Error description"

### `/api/storage/avatars/[filename]` (GET)
**Purpose**: Serve avatar images

**Authentication**: Not required (public access)

**Response**: Image file with proper MIME type and caching headers

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Storage Configuration
STORAGE_PATH=C:\Users\honer\Documents\src\car-project-manager\storage
USE_SERVER_STORAGE=true

# Site URL for avatar URL generation
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Upload Functionality
- [ ] Navigate to `/dashboard/profile`
- [ ] Click "Change Photo" button
- [ ] Select an image file (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- [ ] Verify upload progress indicator
- [ ] Check success notification
- [ ] Confirm image appears immediately
- [ ] Verify page refresh shows uploaded image

### ✅ File Validation
- [ ] Try uploading non-image file (should fail with error)
- [ ] Try uploading very large file >5MB (should fail with error)
- [ ] Verify error messages are user-friendly

### ✅ Remove Functionality  
- [ ] Upload an avatar first
- [ ] Click "Remove" button
- [ ] Verify removal confirmation
- [ ] Check that avatar reverts to initials
- [ ] Confirm database is updated

### ✅ Persistence
- [ ] Upload avatar
- [ ] Logout and login again
- [ ] Navigate back to profile
- [ ] Verify avatar is still there
- [ ] Check that avatar appears in other parts of app

### ✅ Error Handling
- [ ] Test with network disconnected
- [ ] Test with invalid authentication
- [ ] Verify appropriate error messages
