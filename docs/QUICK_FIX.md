# Quick Fix for Cloudflare Integration Issues

These are quick steps to fix the "cloudflare:sockets" error and related issues when running with Cloudflare tunnel:

## Step 1: Remove .babelrc File (It Requires a Missing Plugin)

```bash
# Delete or rename the .babelrc file
rm .babelrc
# OR
mv .babelrc .babelrc.backup
```

## Step 2: Install Missing Dependencies

```bash
# Install required packages to fix the errors
npm install --save-dev null-loader
npm install --save-dev @types/pg
npm install server-only
```

## Step 3: Clear Next.js Cache

```bash
# Delete the .next directory to clear cache
rm -rf .next
```

## Step 4: Start Development Server

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## What's Been Fixed

1. **Removed .babelrc file** that required the missing babel-plugin-module-resolver
2. **Updated webpack configuration** in next.config.mjs to properly handle "cloudflare:sockets"
3. **Modified database access** to work safely in both client and server environments
4. **Implemented server/client code separation** to prevent server-only code from being bundled with client-side code

If you still encounter issues, try running with `SKIP_DB=true npm run dev` to temporarily bypass database initialization for troubleshooting.
